# IMDB Video Game Ratings Analysis

A machine learning analysis to understand the relationship between video game genres, certificates, and their IMDB ratings. This project implements multiple ML approaches including KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVC to predict game ratings based on genre and certificate data.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of video game ratings from IMDB to investigate whether genre and certificate ratings have a significant impact on overall game ratings. Through various machine learning models and PCA, we explore these relationships and their predictive capabilities.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [IMDB Video Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadadiltalay/imdb-video-games)
- ~20,000 video game entries
- Features include: name, year, certificate, rating, votes, and genre information
- Preprocessed to remove entries with less than 100 votes
- Genre data is represented as boolean values
- Certificate ratings are one-hot encoded

## Key Findings

- The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy at 45.72%
- Genre and certificate data alone are not strong predictors of game ratings
- Action and Adventure are the most common genres in the dataset
- Data shows weak correlations between genres/certificates and ratings
- Model performance significantly exceeds random guessing (10% baseline)

## Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (with n=2, 5, 8)
- Decision Trees (with max_depth=3, 5, 8)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classification (SVC)

## Data Processing
- Removal of duplicates and null values
- One-hot encoding of certificate data
- Filtering games with <100 votes
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction
- Stratified K-Fold cross-validation
